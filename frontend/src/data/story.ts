  title: 'The Keeper and The Bucket',
  orientation: `The old lighthouse keeper, Ms. Amelia, lived a solitary life perched
  on a cliff overlooking a churning sea. Her days were filled with the
  rhythmic clang of the foghorn, the salty spray clinging to her
  weathered face, and the constant companionship of a scruffy seagull
  named Salty. One particularly stormy night, the foghorn malfunctioned.
  Panic clawed at Ms. Amelia's throat. Without the warning, ships could
  crash upon the treacherous rocks.`,
  complication: `Thinking fast, Ms. Amelia grabbed a dented metal bucket and raced to
  the roof. Under the howling wind and blinding rain, she banged the
  bucket repeatedly against the metal railing, mimicking the foghorn's
  deep groan. Salty squawked in protest, but perched bravely on her
  shoulder as she continued the relentless clanging. Throughout the
  night, Ms. Amelia's arm ached, but her determination never faltered.`,
  resolution: `As dawn broke, painting the sky with streaks of pink and orange, the
  storm subsided. Relief washed over Ms. Amelia as she saw a ship change
  course, its horn blaring a grateful salute. Exhausted but exhilarated,
  she settled back in her chair, Salty snuggled beside her. A knock on
  the door startled them. A group of coastguard officers stood there,
  smiles on their faces. They'd heard the "foghorn" and come to
  investigate, but Ms. Amelia's quick thinking had saved the day.`,
  reorientation: `News of Ms. Amelia's heroism spread like wildfire. The old lighthouse
  keeper, once a solitary figure, became a local legend. From that day
  on, she wasn't just the keeper of the lighthouse; she was the keeper
  of the sea. Her days were no longer lonely, filled with visits from
  grateful sailors and townsfolk alike. Salty, ever the loyal companion,
  continued to share her perch, forever a witness to Ms. Amelia's
  bravery.`,
