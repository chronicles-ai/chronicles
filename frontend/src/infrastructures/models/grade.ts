//   "komentar": "Orientation:\nThe orientation establishes the setting of the story, introducing both the city and the forest where the tiger Raju lives. However, the description of the city lacks clarity, and the location of the tiger statue is confusing. Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Clarify the location of the tiger statue in the city.\n2. Provide more vivid details about the city and the forest.\n\nComplication:\nThe complication is introduced when hunters enter the forest and injure Raju. This event creates tension and conflict in the story. However, the motivation of the hunters is unclear. Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Explain why the hunters are after Raju.\n2. Describe the hunters in more detail to create a clearer image of the antagonists.\n\nResolution:\nThe resolution occurs when the tiger statue comes to life and saves Raju. This event is fantastical and provides an exciting conclusion to the story. However, the transformation of the statue is abrupt and lacks explanation. Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Provide a reason for the statue's transformation.\n2. Describe the statue's movement and actions in more detail.\n\nReorientation:\nThe reorientation introduces a new character, Tito, who serves as a contrast to the cat. Tito appreciates the tiger statue, while the cat underestimates it. This comparison helps reinforce the theme of the story. However, the cat's change of heart at the end is sudden and lacks development. Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Show the cat's gradual change of perspective.\n2. Connect the cat's change of heart to the theme of the story.\n\nGrammar and Syntax:\nThe text contains several grammatical and syntactical errors, including subject-verb agreement, article usage, and word choice. Here are some examples:\n\n1. \"in the midle of the road\" should be \"in the middle of the road\"\n2. \"abrave\" should be \"brave\"\n3. \"serioulsly\" should be \"seriously\"\n4. \"teh\" should be \"the\"\n5. \"whot's\" should be \"what's\"\n\nSignificance of Errors:\nCorrecting these errors would improve the clarity and flow of the text, making it easier for readers to understand and enjoy the story.\n\nOverall, the story has potential, but it requires further development and refinement to meet the minimum completeness criteria. The fantastical elements could be more effectively integrated into the story, and the characters could be more fully developed. Additionally, the text would benefit from careful proofreading and editing to correct grammatical and syntactical errors.",

//   "komentar": "Orientation:\nThe orientation sets the scene for the story, introducing the city, the tiger statue, and Raju the tiger. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make it difficult to understand. For example, \"standinga\" should be \"standing,\" \"abrave\" should be \"brave,\" and \"midle\" should be \"middle.\" Additionally, the first sentence is quite long and could be broken up into smaller sentences for clarity.\n\nComplication:\nThe complication is introduced when Raju realizes he needs to be more friendly to make friends. This part of the story is well-developed, with clear conflict and resolution. However, there are still some grammatical errors, such as \"serioulsly\" which should be \"seriously\" and \"innured\" which should be \"injured.\"\n\nResolution:\nThe resolution is weak, as it relies on a magical tiger statue coming to life to save Raju. This is not a satisfying resolution to the conflict introduced earlier in the story. Additionally, the transition between Raju's injury and the arrival of the tiger statue is abrupt and confusing.\n\nReorientation:\nThe reorientation introduces a new character, Tito the mouse, and a new conflict. However, this part of the story feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative. The connection between the tiger statue and the conflict between Tito and the cat is tenuous at best.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Pay close attention to grammar and spelling to ensure clarity and understanding.\n2. Develop the resolution of the conflict more fully, avoiding magical or unlikely solutions.\n3. Ensure that each part of the narrative is connected and flows smoothly into the next.\n4. Consider developing the characters and their motivations more fully to create a more engaging story.\n5. Use descriptive language to create a vivid setting and engaging characters.\n\nOverall, this narrative has potential, but it needs significant development and revision to meet the minimum completeness criteria. The grammatical errors and awkward phrasings make it difficult to understand, and the disconnected narrative and weak resolution detract from the overall quality of the story.",
